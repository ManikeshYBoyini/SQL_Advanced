# 🏈📊 SQL Mastery Project – College Football & Star Market Data

Welcome to my SQL project where I explore and analyze two distinct datasets using advanced SQL concepts. This project demonstrates practical applications of SQL through structured queries, joins, window functions, stored procedures, and more.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This repository contains structured SQL work on two key datasets:

1. **College Football Team & Player Data**
2. **Star Market Trading Data**

The goal is to demonstrate hands-on mastery over various SQL concepts by solving realistic, domain-specific problems.

## 📦 Datasets Used

### 🏈 College Football Dataset
- Team and player performance
- Roster and game statistics
- Position-wise and season-wise comparisons

### 📈 Star Market Dataset
- Stock trades and volumes
- Price analytics and trends
- Daily/monthly performance breakdown

## 🧠 SQL Concepts Covered

The project is built to touch all foundational and intermediate SQL topics, including:

| Category            | Concepts Used |
|---------------------|----------------|
| **Data Retrieval**  | `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY` |
| **Joins**           | `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN` |
| **Set Operations**  | `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT` |
| **Aggregations**    | `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()` |
| **Window Functions**| `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `PARTITION BY`, `OVER()` |
| **Subqueries**      | Correlated & Uncorrelated |
| **Stored Procedures** | Custom logic encapsulated in procedures |
| **Functions**       | Scalar and table-valued functions |
| **Conditional Logic** | `CASE WHEN THEN`, `IF`, `NULLIF`, `COALESCE` |

## 🛠️ Sample Use Cases

- Rank top-performing football players by touchdowns and yardage
- Compare stock trends over time using moving averages and ranks
- Calculate team performance per season using partitioned aggregation
- Build reusable stored procedures to fetch insights dynamically
- Use scalar functions to clean or transform data columns
